# MaskRcnn_tensorflow_cpp_inference
## inference mask_rcnn model with tensorflow c++ api
>this project  consists of three main operations
  >>1. keras model to tensorflow model: because we use front-end keras call the backend tensorflow,so we need to convert keras model to tensorflow model.  
  >>2. inference tensorflow  model with cpp,and  use Eigen3 lib carefully.  
  >>3. note that such as  batch_size,the operation that save model in  gpu or cpu ,must be same as the config you set in the python call.
